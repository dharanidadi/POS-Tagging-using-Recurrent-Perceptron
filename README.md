# POS-Tagging-using-Recurrent-Perceptron

I designed a recurrent perceptron model to identify noun chunks in POS-tagged sentences, achieving an accuracy of 83.7%. I implemented Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. Additionally, I analyzed error cases and examined model weights to ensure the model adhered to linguistic constraints.
